30-projects inspired by JavaScript 30 Course (I actually took the same Styling) to learn more about the basics. Nothing interesting or complicated here, it is a challenge for me to start writing JS apps with clear and 
precise documentation.

## Main Idea & Inspiration

Well, I have been freelancing for quite a lot of time now (4+ years), and during that journey I hoped through a lot 
of projects. While I could make off a lot of money and gain some experience here and there, I found out that I lack the 
principles. I lack some of the most basic principles, **Vanilla JS** or writing a nice markdown **Readme** file (which I never did).

Therefore, while this seems really basic, I wanted to go through having some of the basics re-visited and learnt the correct way.

## Future TODO Ideas:

In every project, I made some TODO comments to be able to track the new updates that I want to make in the future to improve and extend those projects. This is very fun to do and integerate in the project!

## Finished Projects:

* [X] JS Drum Kit
* [] CSS + JS Clock
* [] Playing with CSS Vars and JS
* [] Array Cardio Day 1
* [] Flex Panels Image Gallery
* [] Ajax Type Ahead
* [] Array Cardio Day 2
* [] Fun with HTML5 Canvas

## Background & Contact Info:

I am Mahmoud Amr, a CS Student in ASU, Cairo, Egypt interested in every CS topic you can think about ♥

I have been working as a freelancer for quite a lot of time now (4+ years), and you can expect to find me on a lot of platforms and be able to communicate with me directly at ease. 

While I tried a lot of techs & languages, I am most interested in Software Engineering & AI science. The idea to create such maintanable projects with nice architecture really makes my mood a lot better. 

Yet again, I love to work on: 

* Full-stack projects (PHP as backend, WP or laravel and for frotend VueJS or Angular or Native Vanilla JS)
* RPA (My passion)
* Data Engineering and Scraping/Extracting
